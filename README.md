### Summary
In this reposetory I gathered a few projects I did over the years.

### TeamWork Project
TeamWork is a project I did that is simulating the work that Teamviewer does.\
The idea is that one computer controls an other computer and allows to work together.

### Motion Profiling Project
this project is tring to calculate a path for a robotsdfasdfasd asdfa sdfasd fsadf\
sd fsadf\
sadfasdfsdfasdfasdfs.

### Games
In the games directory you will found snake and tetis implemented in c++.
The games have a console based GUI but the game logic and flow are good and intuitive.
You can try to play the games simply by compiling them with MinGW or any other c++ compiler and run.\
\
For example:
```
$ g++ ./Snake.cpp -o Snake
```

### Sudoku Solver
This project is a simple and short python script that has a grid representing a sudoku board and solves it. 
If there's more the one optional solution the script will print all of them.\
\
Running this script simply by typing in the command line:
```
$ python ./Sudoku_Solver.py
```
